# 112 Dash
## Project Description
It will be based on a simplified version of Geometry Dash, an arcade-runner style game where the character must avoid obstacles on its path by jumping, only difference is my version is endless unless the player crashes. The obstacles on the path are also randomly generated but the path that these obstacles form is still winnable.
